## PISCINE 42 - September 2020 ###

You will find in this repository all my work for the Piscine of September 2020.

All the exercises have been validated by the Moulinette.

Use this code wisely. Copying and pasting this code won't bring you anything, except the risk of being reported and having a -42 flag.

Good luck to you guys ;)
